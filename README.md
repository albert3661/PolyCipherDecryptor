PolyalphabeticCipher
Description:

PolyalphabeticCipher is a Python tool designed to decrypt text encoded with a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, such as the Caesar cipher. This script takes an input string and attempts to decode it by trying all possible key shifts (1 through 26) and outputs the resulting plaintext for each key.

Features:

Converts the input text to lowercase for uniform processing.
Utilizes a character mapping based on shifted alphabet positions.
Handles non-alphabetic characters by leaving them unchanged.
Outputs all possible plaintexts for each key shift, allowing the user to identify the correct key and deciphered text.
