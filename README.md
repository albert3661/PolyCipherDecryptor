# PolyCipherDecryptor
PolyalphabeticCipher is a Python tool designed to decrypt text encoded with a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, such as the Caesar cipher. This script takes an input string and attempts to decode it by trying all possible key shifts (1 through 26) and outputs the resulting plaintext for each key.
